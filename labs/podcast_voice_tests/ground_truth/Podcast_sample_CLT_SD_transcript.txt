[Speaker Guest-1] Wow, what a match. Charlotte FC was absolutely on fire tonight—did you see how Pep BL weaved through everyone to set up that goal for Abada?
[Speaker Guest-2] BL was the standout for sure. His vision and timing were impeccable, though San Diego’s defense just couldn’t keep up.
[Speaker Guest-2] That early strike really set the tone for the rest of the game.
[Speaker Guest-1] And Reyes had a rough night—two quick yellows and then he was off. It felt like Charlotte knew exactly how to pressure him. Ajamang was relentless.
[Speaker Guest-2] That penalty call was needless. You can’t gift goal-scoring chances to a team unbeaten at home; Reyes will have plenty to think about after that.
[Speaker Guest-1] Then there was Privett’s header—his first MLS goal on his 50th appearance. Pure magic; I doubt even he saw that one coming.
[Speaker Guest-1] The delivery from Westwood was perfect. Privett capitalized, especially with San Diego down a man. Charlotte’s set pieces are something else—San Diego has to shore those up.
[Speaker Guest-2] Dean Smith was right: we should have scored more. The passing was crisp, but we left too many chances on the table.
[Speaker Guest-2] A little constructive criticism only makes us better. Staying motivated is key, even at the top of the table.
[Speaker Guest-1] Absolutely. There’s room for improvement, but this game showed how far we’ve come. Now it’s about carrying this momentum into next week’s match against New England.
[Speaker Guest-2] I’m curious how San Diego will respond—they’ve got talent, but adapting defensively to this league is always a challenge.
[Speaker Guest-1] True, but tonight was all about celebration. Charlotte FC is on a roll and I can’t wait to see what comes next!
