## **üéØ Getting Started: Hello World**

**Best for**: Newcomers, proof-of-concept development, learning the basics.

| Notebook | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `01-create-your-first-rt-agent.ipynb` | Build a complete customer support voice agent |
| `03-create-your-first-foundry-agents.ipynb` | Create Azure AI Foundry agents |
| `04-exploring-live-api.ipynb` | Explore Azure Live Voice API integration |
| `05-create-your-first-livevoice.ipynb` | Build with Live Voice capabilities |

### **Quick Start**
1. Start with notebook 01 if you're new to the project
2. Follow notebooks in sequence
3. Each notebook is self-contained with working examples

## **üß™ Advanced Labs**

**Best for**: Framework extension, research experiments, specific use cases.

Advanced notebooks for understanding and extending framework components.

#### **Voice Testing (`labs/podcast_voice_tests/`)**

Audio quality experiments and voice model comparisons:

- **Ground truth recordings** for quality benchmarking
- **Multiple TTS model outputs** for voice comparison
- **Production voice samples** for different use cases

#### **Recording Storage (`labs/recordings/`)**

Test recordings and audio samples for development and debugging.

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Prerequisites**

### **Environment Setup**
- **Python 3.11+** 
- **Dependencies**: Install with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- **Jupyter environment** for running notebooks

### **Azure Services Required**
- **Azure Speech Services** (STT/TTS)
- **Azure OpenAI** (GPT models and function calling)
- **Azure Communication Services** (for phone integration)
- **Azure Redis** (for state management)

### **Configuration**
Ensure your `.env` file contains the required Azure service credentials before running any notebooks.

## üîß **Usage Guidelines**

### **Running Notebooks**
1. **Navigate to project root** before starting Jupyter
2. **Activate conda environment**: `conda activate audioagent`
3. **Start Jupyter**: `jupyter lab` or use VS Code
4. **Follow notebook order** for structured learning

### **Code Safety**
- ‚úÖ **All code in notebooks is production-tested and working**
- ‚úÖ **Feel free to experiment and modify for your use cases**
- ‚úÖ **Each notebook includes error handling and cleanup**

### **Troubleshooting**
- **Environment issues**: Check conda environment activation
- **Import errors**: Ensure you're running from project root directory
- **Azure service errors**: Verify credentials in `.env` file
