## 1. Overview

This document outlines key integration points and scenarios for adopting the FastAPI-based Azure Voice Agent backend into existing AWS-based client environments, including AWS Connect and telephony backends.

---

## 2. Integration Scenarios

### 2.1 AWS Connect with Azure Voice Backend

**Scenario:** Enterprise uses AWS Connect for contact center telephony and wants to leverage Azure's real-time voice agent backend for advanced speech, transcription, or LLM-powered workflows.

**Integration Points:**

- **API Gateway:**
  - Expose FastAPI endpoints (e.g., `/api/call`, `/call/stream`) via public API Gateway (AWS API Gateway or Azure API Management)
  - Secure endpoints with OAuth2/JWT or AWS IAM roles
  
- **AWS Lambda / Step Functions:**
  - Use Lambda functions to invoke FastAPI endpoints for call events, transcription, or agent actions
  - Pass call metadata (session/correlation IDs) for traceability
  
- **WebSocket Streaming:**
  - AWS Connect streams audio to Lambda or Kinesis; adapt to forward PCM audio frames to FastAPI `/call/stream` WebSocket endpoint
  - Use AWS SDKs or custom connectors to bridge audio streams
  
- **State Management:**
  - Use Redis for ephemeral session state, accessible from both AWS and Azure (via VPC peering or managed Redis)
  
- **Event Handling:**
  - Integrate AWS EventBridge or SNS/SQS with FastAPI's event endpoints for cross-cloud event propagation

### 2.2 AWS Connect to Azure Communication Services

**Scenario:** AWS Connect is the entry point for inbound calls, but calls need to be routed to Azure Communication Services (ACS) for advanced processing or agent handoff.

#### 2.2.1 High-Level Support Matrix

|------------|-----------|---------------|-------|
| SIP trunk hand-off | **Yes** | AWS Connect ‚Üí SBC ‚Üí ACS | External Voice Transfer Connector (Connect) ‚ü∑ Direct Routing (ACS) |
| Keep existing IVR | **Yes** | AWS Connect | Only the live agent leg is transferred to ACS |
| Dual call recording | **Yes** | Both | Correlate Connect ContactId ‚Üî ACS serverCallId |
| WebSocket media stream | **Yes (ACS)** | ACS | Bidirectional PCM frames for ASR/TTS/Bot |
| Live media from Connect | **Yes (Kinesis)** | Amazon Connect | Use Live Media Streaming block ‚Üí Kinesis |
| Chat / messaging federation | **No** | ‚Äî | Separate SDKs, build your own bridge |
| Unified agent desktop | **Not OOTB** | ‚Äî | Build/buy custom desktop for CCP + ACS |
| Cross-platform metrics | **Custom** | ‚Äî | Pipe EventBridge + Azure Monitor ‚Üí BI |

- **Network Connectivity:**
  - Ensure low-latency, secure connectivity between AWS and Azure
  - Consider VPN, ExpressRoute, or VPC peering options
  
- **Monitoring & Logging:**
  - Centralize logs and metrics (Azure Monitor, AWS CloudWatch, or third-party SIEM)
  - Implement unified observability across clouds
  
- **Compliance:**
  - Ensure data residency and compliance requirements are met
  - Validate cross-cloud data transfer policies

## 3. Service Mapping & Interchangeability


![AWS Service Mapping Architecture](assets/RTAudio_AWSMapped.png)


| Azure Service | AWS Equivalent | Interchangeable? | Notes |
|---------------|----------------|------------------|-------|
| Azure Communication Services (ACS) | Amazon Chime SDK, Connect | Partial | AWS Connect is managed contact center; Chime SDK offers programmable voice/video. SIP trunking can bridge both. |
| Azure Redis Cache | Amazon ElastiCache (Redis) | Yes | Both offer managed Redis. Session state and pub/sub patterns are portable. |
| Azure App Service / Container Apps | AWS Elastic Beanstalk, ECS | Yes | Both support containerized and web app hosting. |
| Azure API Management (APIM) | AWS API Gateway | Yes | Both provide API gateway, security, and throttling. |
| Azure Event Grid | Amazon EventBridge, SNS/SQS | Yes | Event-driven integration is possible with both. |
| Azure Monitor / Log Analytics | AWS CloudWatch, X-Ray | Yes | Centralized logging and monitoring. |
| Azure Cognitive Services (Speech) | Amazon Transcribe, Polly | Partial | Both offer STT/TTS, but APIs and models differ. Real-time streaming may require adaptation. |
| Azure Cosmos DB | Amazon DynamoDB, DocumentDB | Yes | Both are NoSQL/document DBs. |
| Azure Blob Storage | Amazon S3 | Yes | Both are object storage. |
| Azure Virtual Network (VNet) | Amazon VPC | Yes | Both provide private networking. |
| Azure ExpressRoute/VPN Gateway | AWS Direct Connect/VPN | Yes | For cross-cloud secure connectivity. |
| Azure Application Gateway | AWS Application Load Balancer | Yes | Both provide Layer 7 load balancing, SSL termination, and WAF. |
| Azure Private DNS Zone | AWS Route 53 Private Hosted Zone | Yes | Both provide private DNS resolution within virtual networks. |
| Azure AI Foundry | AWS SageMaker Studio | Partial | Both provide MLOps platforms. AI Foundry focuses on responsible AI and evaluation workflows. |
| Azure AI Studio | AWS Bedrock Studio | Partial | Both offer no-code/low-code AI model interaction interfaces. |
| Azure Key Vault | AWS Secrets Manager, Parameter Store | Yes | Both provide secure secret storage. Key Vault supports certificates; Secrets Manager focuses on rotation. |

**General Guidance:**
- Most infrastructure and data services are interchangeable with configuration and API adaptation
- Voice/telephony and real-time media services may require significant integration work
- LLM services (Azure OpenAI vs. Amazon Bedrock) may need prompt/response pattern adaptation

---

## 4. LLM Integration Patterns

**Scenario:** FastAPI backend needs to invoke LLMs for conversational intelligence, summarization, or agent decision-making.

### 4.1 Provider Integration Points

**Azure OpenAI Service:**
- Use `azure-ai` Python SDK or REST API for deployed models (e.g., `gpt-4o-mini`)
- Secure with managed identity or service principal from Azure Key Vault
- Endpoint: `POST https://{your-resource}.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/{deployment}/completions`

**AWS Bedrock / SageMaker:**
- Route LLM requests via AWS Lambda or direct SDK calls
- Secure with IAM roles and AWS SDK credentials

**Other LLM Providers:**
- Support pluggable adapter pattern for OpenAI, Cohere, Anthropic, or self-hosted models
- Consider LangChain abstractions for provider flexibility

### 4.2 LLM Evaluation & Fine-Tuning

**Azure AI Foundry Integration:**
- Comprehensive evaluation metrics (safety, coherence, relevance, fluency)
- Built-in evaluation flows for A/B testing prompts, models, and configurations
- Use Azure AI Foundry's evaluation SDK: `from azure.ai.evaluation import evaluate_conversation`

**AWS vs Azure Evaluation Support:**
- **Azure**: AI Foundry offers end-to-end evaluation pipelines with visual dashboards
- **AWS**: Bedrock provides model evaluation but requires more manual setup for conversation metrics
- Azure's evaluation tooling is more mature for conversational AI scenarios

**Iterative Improvement Workflow:**
- Implement evaluation checkpoints in FastAPI endpoints
- Use session-based evaluation data for prompt improvements
- Set up automated evaluation pipelines triggered by deployment

### 4.3 Design Considerations

- Abstract provider-specific logic behind common interface in `handlers/llm` module
- Manage prompt templates and rate limits
- Ensure conversational context (session_id) is passed for continuity
- Implement retry and fallback strategies

---

## 5. Validation & Testing

**Proof-of-Concept Validation:**
- Validate prompt/response formats and latency for each provider under real-world load
- Benchmark throughput and error rates
- Test cross-cloud connectivity and security
- Validate compliance and data residency requirements

**Performance Testing:**
- End-to-end latency testing (<500ms target for voice applications)
- Load testing for concurrent sessions
- Failover and error handling scenarios
- Audio quality validation for media streaming

**Security Testing:**
- Cross-cloud authentication and authorization
- Network security and encryption validation
- API security and rate limiting
- Compliance audit trail verification
