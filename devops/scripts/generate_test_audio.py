Standalone Audio File Generator for Load Testing

This script generates realistic customer audio files using Azure Speech Services
for testing the various agent flows (Auth, FNOL, General Info).

Usage:
    python generate_test_audio.py
    python generate_test_audio.py --output-dir ./test_audio --count 10
    python generate_test_audio.py --agent-type auth --voice "en-US-AriaNeural"
