# üéôÔ∏è **RTVoice Accelerator**  
*Omni-channel, real-time voice-intelligence accelerator framework on Azure*

**RTAgent** is an accelerator that delivers a friction-free, AI-driven voice experience‚Äîwhether callers dial a phone number, speak to an IVR, or click ‚ÄúCall Me‚Äù in a web app. Built entirely on generally available Azure services‚ÄîAzure Communication Services, Azure AI, and Azure App Service‚Äîit provides a low-latency stack that scales on demand while keeping the AI layer fully under your control.

Design a single agent or orchestrate multiple specialist agents (claims intake, authorization triage, appointment scheduling‚Äîanything). The framework allows you to build your voice agent from scratch, incorporate long- and short-term memory, configure actions, and fine-tune your TTS and STT layers to give any workflow an intelligent voice.

## **Overview**

> **88 %** of customers still make a **phone call** when they need real support  
> ‚Äî yet most IVRs feel like 1999. **RTAgent** fixes that.

**RTAgent in a nutshell**

RT Agent is a plug-and-play accelerator, voice-to-voice AI pipeline that slots into any phone line, web client, or CCaaS flow. Caller audio arrives through Azure Communication Services (ACS), is transcribed by a dedicated STT component, routed through your agent chain of LLMs, tool calls, and business logic, then re-synthesised by a TTS component‚Äîall in a sub-second round-trip. Because each stage runs as an independent microservice, you can swap models, fine-tune latency budgets, or inject custom logic without touching the rest of the stack. The result is natural, real-time conversation with precision control over every hop of the call.

| What you get | How it helps |
|--------------|--------------|
| **Sub-second loop** (STT ‚Üí LLM/Tools ‚Üí TTS) | Conversations feel human, not robotic latency-ridden dialogs. |
| **100 % GA Azure stack** | No private previews, no hidden SKUs‚Äîeasy procurement & support. |
| **Drop-in YAML agents** | Spin up FNOL claims bots, triage nurses, or legal intake in minutes. |
| **Micro-service architecture** | Swap models, tune latency, or add new business logic without redeploying the whole stack. |

## Deploy and Customize the Demo App Using the RTAgent Framework

### **üöÄ One-Command Azure Deployment**

Provision the full solution‚Äîincluding App Gateway, Container Apps, Cosmos DB, Redis, OpenAI, and Key Vault‚Äîwith a single command:

```bash
azd auth login
azd up   # ~15 min for complete infra and code deployment
```

**Key Features:**
- TLS managed by Key Vault and App Gateway
- KEDA auto-scales RT Agent workers
- All outbound calls remain within a private VNet

For a detailed deployment walkthrough, see [`docs/DeploymentGuide.md`](docs/DeploymentGuide.md).

### *‚ö° Run the app Local*

**Prerequisites:** Infra deployed (above), Conda, Node.js ‚â• 18, Azure CLI with `dev-tunnel` extension.

**Backend (FastAPI + Uvicorn):**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/gbb-ai-audio-agent.git
cd gbb-ai-audio-agent/rtagents/RTAgent/backend
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.sample .env   # Configure ACS, Speech, and OpenAI keys
python server.py      # Starts backend at ws://localhost:8010/realtime
```

**Frontend (Vite + React):**
```bash
cd ../../frontend
npm install
npm run dev           # Starts frontend at http://localhost:5173
```

## **Deployment on Azure**

### Standard Deployment (Recommended)

```bash
azd auth login
azd up         # full infra + code (~15 min)
```

### Alternative Deployment (Without azd)

For environments where Azure Developer CLI cannot be used, we provide make targets that emulate azd functionality:

```bash
# Set required environment variables
export AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID="<your-subscription-id>"
export AZURE_ENV_NAME="dev"
export AZURE_LOCATION="eastus2"

# Full deployment
make azure_up
```

**Alternative methods:**

1. **Using the azd emulator script:**
   ```bash
   # Unix/Linux/macOS
   ./devops/scripts/azd-emulator.sh up
   
   # Windows PowerShell
   .\devops\scripts\azd-emulator.ps1 up
   ```

2. **Step-by-step deployment:**
   ```bash
   make azure_init        # Initialize environment
   make azure_plan        # Review infrastructure plan
   make azure_provision   # Deploy infrastructure
   make azure_deploy      # Deploy applications
   ```
