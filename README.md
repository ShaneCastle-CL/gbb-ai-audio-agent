**RTMedAgent** is a real-time voice agent that enables healthcare organizations to deliver **empathetic and intelligent voice-first experiences** using a cascade of **Azure AI services**. Built for patient-facing support scenarios, the system simulates a smart and responsive voice agent capable of assisting users with everyday healthcare tasks by combining the following technologies:

- **Azure Speech-to-Text** for real-time transcription  
- **Azure AI Search** for semantic understanding and intent recognition  
- **Azure Text-to-Speech** to generate human-like responses  
- **Azure OpenAI with Function Calling and Streaming Output** to dynamically trigger backend actions  
- **WebSocket architecture** to ensure low-latency, two-way voice interaction  

This intelligent voice agent assists with common healthcare workflows like appointment scheduling, prescription refills, medication guidance, and prior authorization evaluations, all while maintaining high standards for safety, privacy, and clarity.


## **üìû Addressing Burnout and Enhancing Efficiency in Healthcare Call Centers**

> "Healthcare call centers spend, on average, 43% of their annual operating budget on labor costs but only 0.6% on technologies to prevent agent burnout and turnover"  
> ‚Äî *[The State of Healthcare Call Centers, Hyro](https://assets-002.noviams.com/novi-file-uploads/pac/PDFs-and-Documents/Industry_Partners/Hyro_-_The_State_of_Healthcare_Call_Centers_2023_Report-fa539649.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)‚Äã*


Healthcare call centers are the frontline of patient interaction, yet they grapple with high turnover rates and staff burnout. A study by the Quality Assurance & Training Connection (QATC) indicates that the average call center agent turnover rate ranges between 30%‚Äì45%. This attrition not only affects service quality but also escalates operational costs.‚Äã By embracing AI-driven tools, healthcare organizations can enhance efficiency, reduce staff turnover, and ultimately improve patient satisfaction.
