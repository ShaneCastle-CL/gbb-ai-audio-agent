"""
This module defines Pydantic models for managing and validating data structures 
used in Redis interactions within the application. These models are designed to 
ensure data consistency and provide type safety when working with Redis.

Classes:
    TurnHistoryItem:
        Represents a single turn in a conversation history, including the role 
        ('user' or 'agent'), the text of the message, and a timestamp.

    SessionState:
        Represents the state of a user session, including session ID, user ID, 
        activity status, turn number, last input, mute status, and language preference.

    CallAutomationEvent:
        Represents events related to call automation, including session ID, event type, 
        timestamp, and optional metadata.

Notes:
    Benefits of using models for Redis:
    - Ensures data validation and type safety, reducing runtime errors.
    - Provides a clear schema for data stored in Redis, improving maintainability.
    - Facilitates serialization and deserialization of data for Redis operations.
    - Enhances readability and documentation of the codebase.
