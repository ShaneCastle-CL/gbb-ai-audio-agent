## Known Limitations & TODOs

### Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Improvements

- **Network Configuration Modularization**: Break down network configuration from monolithic structure into reusable modules
  - Extract `networkv2.bicep` into smaller, focused modules (e.g., `vnet.bicep`, `subnets.bicep`, `nsg.bicep`, `private-endpoints.bicep`)
  - Create parameterized network modules for hub-spoke topology vs. simple public-only configurations
  - Standardize subnet delegation and address space allocation across modules
  - **Status**: Current networkv2.bicep is functional but monolithic - needs modularization for maintainability

- **Main.bicep Decomposition**: Restructure large main.bicep file into logical, manageable modules
  - Split into domain-specific modules: `compute.bicep`, `data.bicep`, `ai-services.bicep`, `security.bicep`
  - Implement consistent parameter passing and output handling across modules
  - Create environment-specific parameter files (dev, staging, prod) for cleaner deployments
  - Add module dependency management and proper `dependsOn` configurations
  - **Status**: Main.bicep currently ~500+ lines - target modular structure with <100 lines per module

- **Public-Only Network Configuration**: Add support for simplified public-only deployments
  - Create alternative network topology without private endpoints for development/demo scenarios
  - Implement conditional logic to deploy public vs. private configurations based on parameters
  - Maintain security best practices even in public-only mode (NSGs, WAF, managed identities)
  - Document trade-offs between public-only and private endpoint architectures
  - **Status**: Currently only supports private endpoint architecture - public-only option needed for flexibility

- **Load Testing Infrastructure**: Add dedicated load testing components and configurations
  - Create `loadtest.bicep` module for Azure Load Testing service provisioning
  - Configure test data generators for synthetic call traffic and concurrent user scenarios
  - Set up performance monitoring dashboards specific to load testing scenarios
  - Implement automated load test execution via Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions
  - Add capacity planning guidelines and auto-scaling validation scripts
  - **Status**: No load testing infrastructure currently provisioned - critical for production readiness validation

### Communication & Integration Issues
- **ACS Integration Failure**: Current deployment experiences communication failures between backend and Azure Communication Services
  - SSL certificate is properly configured and frontend‚Üîbackend communication is functional
  - ACS webhook callbacks may be failing due to routing or authentication issues
  - Requires investigation of ACS service configuration and webhook endpoint accessibility
  - WebSocket connections for real-time audio streaming may need troubleshooting
  - **Status**: Known issue as of 7/1/2025 handoff - pending investigation and future update

- **Azure Service Authentication**: Post-ACS resolution, comprehensive validation needed for EntraID-based service-to-service authentication
  - **AI Gateway (APIM)**: Verify managed identity credentials for Azure OpenAI API calls through API Management
  - **Cosmos DB**: Ensure backend can authenticate and access conversation history and call analytics data
  - **Redis Cache**: Validate session state management and real-time transcript storage access
  - **Speech Services**: Confirm STT/TTS operations work with EntraID authentication for transcription pipeline
  - **Status**: Authentication framework in place but requires end-to-end testing once ACS communication is stable

### Technical Debt & Improvements

- **SBC Configuration**: Session Border Controller setup still requires manual configuration and testing
- **Call Flow Validation**: End-to-end testing from PSTN ‚Üí ACS ‚Üí Backend ‚Üí AI pipeline needs comprehensive validation
